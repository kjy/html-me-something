                        I was born in St. Louis city and grew up in south St. Louis county. My parents were immigrants from South Korea. They worked a lot and 
                        eventually bought a home and had their own business.  I was born in the US and my primary language is English.  From 2nd to 12th grade, I attended
                        Lindbergh School District. I was raised christian, mostly Presbyterian and Lutheran, and socially conservative. 
                        Besides my parents, I have a sister who is 2 years older than me. I had a beloved golden retriever, named Andi. 
                        She had been with the family through my teen, college, and grad school years. She lived for 18 years.

                        I have female gender identity and am heterosexual. I'm 5 feet 1 inch tall. I'm left-handed and began wearing glasses 
                        around the age of 20. I wear size 6 in shoes. I played classical piano from age 4 to 14. I was a big Cardinals baseball and Blues hockey fan when 
                        I was in high school. I went to a lot of sporting events since I was a cheerleader. I also played varsity field hockey. I tried out for soccer
                        and walked away with a bloody nose (not broken). I did not make the team. I once ran in a track event, a half mile race, and came in 12th place. 
                        A favorite childhood memory is going to The Muny to see "Annie". I went to sleepovers, swim parties, canoeing, Six Flags, and went to parties as a teenager.  
                        Overall, I had a good childhood and had a good family life.

                    <h2>College Years</h2>
                    <p id="sandiego">
                        I went to a west coast university in San Diego, California.  Fresh ocean breeze and sunny blue skies.  Most of the dorm railings were filled with beach towels and leaning surf boards. 
                        It was a multicultural place where I had my liberal arts education. To my surprise, I actually won a small athletic scholarship from the university's athletic department, 
                        which was enough to pay for books for a term. I can't recall why I got it (surely not for a bloody nose from a soccer tryout I did not make and 12th place in a track race). 
                        I learned Spanish in San Diego as many locals in San Diego spoke Mexican Spanish. I took a couple of Korean classes and visited my Korean relatives in Los Angeles on breaks, 
                        trying hard as heck to understand their more native Korean.  I was exploring my Korean cultural heritage as well as latino culture.  One of my favorite memories was taking a 
                        tennis class as our instructor was a former Hawaiian state tennis champion. We learned drills and practiced a lot with each other and the ball machine. I also took intramural tennis. 
                        I regret not taking an ocean sailing/kayaking class, though I was not a strong ocean swimmer, which was one of the requirements.   I had a lot of friends through my sorority 
                        but also made a lot of local friends who were from San Diego. My first job after college was working as an Administrative Assistant at the Engineering school at UCSD. 
                        I reported to a Financial Manager of the school and a Director of Computing. Fresh mangos with a scent of Mexico were on my desk on some Monday mornings when the Financial 
                        Manager returned from her weekend trips from Mexico.  It was a good first job.  I rented a room in a beach house in Del Mar from an employee who also worked at the university. 
                        From my walkout rooftop, there was a sunset view of Del Mar cliffs and the ocean.

                    <h2>Where I want to go as a Coder</h2>
                    <p id="coding">
                        I have programming skills in Python and Javascript and soon I will learn Java and more of C++. My dream has been to work as a Data Engineer 
                        since I have attained 8 years of coding and data science skills too. Looking ahead, I've thought about 
                        becoming a Solutions Architect, perhaps in a role as a consultant.  I like having the expertise to help clients with making technical decisions about their IT
                        needs and the choices over different softwares or databases.   All I know is that I'll go with the flow in life. That's what makes life interesting.
